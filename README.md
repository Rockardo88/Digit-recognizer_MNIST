# Digit-recognizer_MNIST
In this project i created a neural network to classifiy some handwritten digits. The data used for this scope was the MNIST dataset. I considered the adamax optimizer and also used the dropout function to eliminate the overfitting. The final results of the model are very good, as the accuracy  is around 0.9733 and the loss around 0.0988.
